## Overview
This was my first project that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JS was very minimal as it was only needed to expand/collapse the questions.

## My process
Seeing that this was going to be an accordion, I divided the content into 3 groups: FAQ , Questions, Answers. This allowed me to call a specific part of the content and manipulate the CSS independently. This also allowed me to add an icon next to the Question div, which served as an additional affordance for the accordion.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I'm learning how to call things on JS, and I feel like this was a good step towards that learning. I'm also getting getting at flexbox and spacing out content.

### Continued development
I'd like to improve on my JS calls, especially when it comes to state changes (buttons, dropdowns, etc).
